# Grocery Buddy

Welcome to Grocery Buddy! Grocery Buddy is an application that will help users find the best stores, prices, and deals for all their grocery-related needs. The program uses receipts from users to add stores, products, and prices to a MySQL databse that is hosted on a Google Cloud server. Then, the user can access the database in many ways. The functionality of the program will be outlined in this file.

For an in-depth explanation on how to set up the program, please visit our "Running the Program" page Confluence wiki: https://grocerybuddy.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GROCERYBUD/pages/8945667/Running+the+Program
